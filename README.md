### Prerequisites ###

The workshop is intended to work with an Oracle PaaS trial account. To get an account look into [here](common/request.for.trial.md). Get the following account details ready to complete the tutorial and replace to your values when it is required:

+ Oracle Cloud account **username** and **password**
+ Oracle Cloud **identity domain**
+ **Data center/region**

NOTE: Before you start to use your new Oracle Public Cloud services make sure that the replication policy has been set for your account. Otherwise you can not create storage container which is necessary for most of the services. See [Selecting a Replication Policy for Oracle Storage Cloud Service](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/storagecs_common/CSSTO/GUID-5D53C11F-3D9E-43E4-8D1D-DDBB95DEC715.htm).
